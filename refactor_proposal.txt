== proposal to refactor google code ==
== version 1 - terry 1/12 ==



= proposed directory movements = 

ahfh, ee561, cml, cml2 - specific simulation/analytical projects. move to numeric/

branch - terry's first generalization of the cluster worker controller
           in which workers are specified as .m files passed directly
           to the controller on startup.  The controller runs the same
           worker for its entire lifetime.
  
           move to old/

localtexmf - bibtex database.  move to folder bib/
