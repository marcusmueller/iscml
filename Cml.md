# Introduction #

The Coded Modulation Library (CML) is a library of communication
system simulations developed at West Virginia University.

  * Implemented using MATLAB and C-mex
  * Free software licensed under the lesser GPL


## Brief List of Features ##
  * **Modulation**: PSK, QAM, APSK, CPM (CPFSK)

  * **Channel models**: AWGN, ergodic Rayleigh, block Rayleigh

  * **Channel Coding**: convolutional, turbo, BTC, LDPC, Hybrid-ARQ
    * User-specified LDPC parity-check matrices

  * **Information theoretic bounds**: channel capacity, outage probability

  * **Two-way relay channel physical-layer network coding**: noncoherent FSK relay receiver

A detailed list of features can be found [here](CmlFeatures.md).
