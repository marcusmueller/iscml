% cwc   create cluster worker controller object
%
%
%   The calling syntax is:
%     cwc_obj = cwc(cf)
%
%   Inputs:
%      cf = Configuration file specifying
%             - List of cluster nodes and maximum workers per node.
%             - Input and output paths for worker data.
%
%   Outputs:
%      cwc_obj = cluster worker controller object
%
%   Example:
%      [cwc_obj] = cwc( 'eight_core.cfg' );
