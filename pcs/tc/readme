== PCS task controller ==

The purpose of this module is to move task files from the user input directories to
the global input directory for execution by the generic workers.


The module ctc scans the user input directories for task files and places
them in the global queue.


The generic workers execute on the compute nodes and are started by module cwc.
The workers scan the global input queue for task files and execute the accompanying tasks.
Generic workers log their activity in the log/ directory.


The queue/ directory contains the global task queues.


The supp/ directory contains the script which starts and stop PCS.
