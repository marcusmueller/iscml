NAME
    launch - launch a job 

SYNOPSIS
    launch job-no

DESCRIPTION
    This command launches a job identified by job-no on the Frontier system. 
    The argument job-no is a job handle that was returned by newjob.

    The launch command will return immediately and the launch will happen
    in background. A listener will continue to run in background until the
    job completes or until it is stopped. If you exit Rapids, the listener 
    will continue to run in background. 

ENVIRONMENT
    If the waitFlag system property is set to "true", the listener will
    block instead of running in background.
