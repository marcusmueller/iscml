NAME
    kill - kill a job

SYNOPSIS
    kill job-no
    kill job-no task-no

DESCRIPTION
    This first form of this command sends a kill job signal to a jobs 
    listener for the job identified by job-no. The kill signal causes 
    the job to be terminated and removed from the Frontier server. The 
    local state and results of the job will not be removed. 

    The second form of this command sends a kill task signal to the job 
    listener for the job identified by job-no. The kill task signal causes 
    the task identified by task-no to be terminated. TaskIDs can be obtained
    from the status command.

    If a listener is not running for the job when the kill signal is sent, 
    the signal will not be handled until a listener is started.
