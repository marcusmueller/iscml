NAME
    list - list the jobs in the job repository

SYNOPSIS
    list [-s]

DESCRIPTION
    This command list the jobs currently in the job repository along with
    their job number and the newjob command used to create them.

    If the -s option is specified, the jobs defined on the server are 
    listed instead. If this option is used, the output lists the local
    jobId, the Frontier server job ID, and the launch date. This command
    is useful if the current job repository and the server get out of
    synch (e.g., because a job definition was manually deleted from the
    job repository). If this happens, the remove command can be used 
    to remove the job from the server. The delete -f command can be used
    to delete a local job definition that has no corresponding job on the 
    Frontier Server.
