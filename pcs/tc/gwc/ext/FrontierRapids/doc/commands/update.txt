NAME
    update - add new tasks to an existing job

SYNOPSIS
    update job-id [nTasks]

DESCRIPTION
    This command adds tasks to an already existing job. The calling 
    syntax differs depending on whether the job is based on a simple
    template (no dataset) or a complex template (takes a dataset). In
    the case of a simple job, the nTasks parameter must be specified.
    This parameter determines how many tasks are added to the job. In 
    the case of a complex job, additional input files and/or parameters
    must be added to the data set prior to executing this command. You
    don't specify nTasks when updating a complex job because the number
    of tasks to be added is determined by the data set alone.

    If you plan on updating a job, you will normally want to create the
    job with the keep-running option to the newjob command. This will
    prevent the job from terminating when all the currently created 
    tasks are complete (see newjob). 

    A running listener will pick up and launch the new tasks almost 
    immediately. If no listener is running, the tasks will not be 
    launched until a listener is started.
