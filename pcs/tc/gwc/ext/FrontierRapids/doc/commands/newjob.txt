NAME
    newjob - creates a new job from a template

SYNOPSIS
    newjob template-name num-tasks result-set [keep-running] 
    newjob template-name data-set result-set [keep-running]

DESCRIPTION
    The first form of of the command is used creating jobs from templates
    that don't include input parameters (parameters.txt) or input files
    (inputFiles.txt). In this situation, there is no need for an input data
    set. All tasks will have the same inputs. The number of tasks in the
    job is determined by num-tasks. The result-set parameter identifies the
    result set that will hold the job results.

    The second form of of the command is used creating jobs from templates
    that include input parameters (parameters.txt) and/or input files
    (inputFiles.txt). In this case, data-set specifies the name of the 
    input data set where the input files and/or parameter file can be found.
    The number of tasks in the job is determined by the number or input files
    or the number of lines in the parameter file. The result-set parameter 
    identifies the result set that will hold the job results.

    If the keep-running flag is specified, the job will not automatically
    terminate when the last task is completed. Normally this is used if you
    plan to add new tasks to a job as it is running (see the update command). 
    If you us the keep-running flag, you must explicitly kill the job using
    the kill command when you are done.

    The newjob command returns a unique job number (job-no) that is used as
    a handle for the job.
