Overview
========
Frontier Rapids 5 is an environment for running native jobs on Frontier. 
Please see the Frontier Rapids User Guide (UserGuide.pdf) for 
information on the usage of Rapids.

System Requirements
===================
Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7 or Generic Unix (includes MAC OS X)
Java Runtime Environment 5.0 or later

To run Rapids jobs, you will also need a Frontier client account with 
credentials installed on your machine. 

If you plan to run unmanaged native applications, some special setup is required
on the Frontier side. Specifically,

- Your client account requires privilege to run native code.

- Your client account must be associated with a node group containing 
  nodes that are enabled to run native code.

Send e-mail to support@parabon.com for help in setting up your account 
or setting up your node group.

Installation
============
- Run the Frontier Rapids Installer (FrontierRapids5_0_0_0.exe for
  Windows, FrontierRapids5_0_0_0.bin for Linux).

- The first time you run Frontier Rapids, you will be asked which
  Frontier server you are using (i.e., the Parabon server or the 
  Global Grid Exchange server) and will be asked for the keystore
  password you established when you set up your Frontier account.
