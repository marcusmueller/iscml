NAME
    delete - deletes job information

SYNOPSIS
    delete [-f] job-no

DESCRIPTION
    The delete command deleted the job information for the job identified by
    job-no from the job repository. The result set for the job (stored with
    the job template) is not deleted. A job can only be deleted if it is 
    completed (either as a result of normal termination or killed with kill).

    If the -f command is specified, the job is deleted even if there is no
    corresponding job defined on the Frontier Server (or if there is any 
    other type of corruption in the job). This can be useful if the job is 
    removed from the Frontier Server using a client other than Rapids.
