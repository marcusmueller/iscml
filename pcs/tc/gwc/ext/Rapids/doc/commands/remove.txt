
NAME
    remove - remove the specified job from the Frontier Server

SYNOPSIS
    remove [-s] job-no

DESCRIPTION

    This command removes the specified job from the Frontier Server. This 
    is an advanced command. Normally, jobs are removed from the server 
    automatically when they are completed or killed.  This can be useful if
    the Job Repository and the server get out of synch (e.g., because a 
    job definition was manually deleted from the Job Repository). The 
    job-no parameter is the local Rapids job number. 

    If the -s option is used, the job number specified must be the Frontier 
    Server job number for the job (see the list -s command). This is useful 
    if you want to remove a job from the server that was not created using 
    Rapids.
