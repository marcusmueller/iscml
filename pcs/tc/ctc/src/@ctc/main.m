%
%  POTENTIAL CAVEAT
%   Added '&' to end of all system() commands in an attempt to
%       prevent hanging.
%  Keep an eye on this one, for example, spawing zombies or leaking memory.
%   Added pause at end of every system command for flow control.
% next attempt - copy operation needs more delay than move
% future impl
%  only use moves
%  group permissions
%
%  Notes
%   removed logic to check for user existence in function
%   consume_output
%   if needed, bring back from main_bak.m
