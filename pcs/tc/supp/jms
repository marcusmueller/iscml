# This file stores startup functions for the job managers supported by pcs.
# Add a startup function here to add a job manager.
#
# Functions are named by convention
#  jm_<name>
# where <name> is the job manager name.
# This name is passed to the pcs startup script to specify
# job manager startup.
#
#  Example
#  Start the job manager having name "cml" in the short queue
#  > pcs short start cml
#
#
#
# All functions accept a single input argument - the queue name
# Queue name takes one value of
# short
# long
# testing 
# The queue name specifies where the job manager must store its task files.
#
#
# Available job managers
#  cml
#  ee561
#  PLBP
#  BEC (simulation of binary erasure channel for EE567 Coding Theory course project)
