== PCS speed profiling ==

Module to compare speed of standalone CML and PCS CML error-rate simulation.


Input
 CML error-rate scenario and record


Output
 Figure which contains two curves: trials generated as a function of time by
    standalone CML
    PCS CML
    
 Figure contained in sp/output/<scenario>_<record>.fig



= Usage Example =

  = Running Profile Scenario
  > ./sp run SpeedProfile 1

   * wait *


  = Stopping Profiling
  > ./sp run SpeedProfile 1
  
   * wait *
  
  > ./sp stop SpeedProfile 1


= Notes =

On initial launch, all CML records in <CMLROOT>/output/<scenario> are deleted.
