== WebCML Account Management Subsystem ==

The purpose of the scripts contained in this hierarchy are to manage user
accounts for WebCML.  The scripts implement the following functionality

1. Add WebCML users to the head node Linux account system
2. Create user directories and configuration files for WebCML projects
3. Send project related e-mails to WebCML users.


= Usage =

These scripts are designed for usage primarily by the web interface,
but may also be called directly from the command line.

The tomcat user, tomcat55, must have sudo privilege to execute the following
commands:
adduser
mkdir
chown
echo (?)


For complete descriptions of syntax, see the script header comments.



= Example: Adding a User =

This example demonstrates adding a user to the system from the command line.

  = Assumptions

  User "tferrett" requests a new account and enrollment in the CML project.
  The user's e-mail address is terry.ferrett@funmail.com.


  = Steps
  1. Log in to the cluster as user pcs using an SSH client.


  2. Create a new Linux user tferrett.
    
    pcs> cd /home/pcs/acct/user
    pcs> ./cr_user tferrett


  3. Create the project directory structure for project "CML"

    pcs> cd /home/pcs/acct/proj
    pcs> ./cr_proj_dir /home/tferrett tferrett cml 


  4. Send message to the user acknowledging account creation.
  
     cd /home/pcs/acct/comm
     pcs> ./send_project_email terry.ferrett@funmail.com 
                          "Subject: Account Creation"
                          "Body: <Text verifying account creation>"

   where the arguments to the script are separated by spaces, rather
   than carriage returns.
