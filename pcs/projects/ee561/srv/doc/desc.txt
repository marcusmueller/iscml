== Introduction to Cluster Controller ==
 
 Purpose and Motivation
   Consider running a MATLAB-based Monte-Carlo simulation on a single computer.
   Certain simulations may take weeks or months to run depending on the parameters.
   We would like a simple way to execute a Monte-Carlo simulation across a computing cluster.

 Overview of Architecture
   A conventional simulation running on a single computer uses a single MATLAB process.
   ** Draw picture of single computer containing a single MATLAB process. **

   Now consider a cluster containing N computers, each having M cores.
   ** Draw picture of cluster **

   One way to implement the parallelism is to execute a single MATLAB process
   on every core of every cluster computer.
   ** Draw MATLAB in every cluster node **

   The cluster controller software is a set of MATLAB classes which run on the head node, and allow a user
   to start and stop worker processes using method calls within MATLAB.



== Cluster Controller Architecture ==

The cluster controller is a set of MATLAB classes which allow the CML user to start
 and stop MATLAB worker processes on the internal cluster nodes from
a pure-MATLAB interface on the head node.

The controller starts and stops MATLAB worker processes on internal
nodes using remote command execution through SSH.  The SSH commands
are implemented within BASH scripts, which are called by the cluster controller
object methods.


== Configuration File ==
The nodes which the cluster controller utilizes are specified in a configuration file, having the following format

*** Begin configuration file ***
[Paths]
InputPath  = P_I
OutputPath = P_O

[Hosts]
host = nodeX_1 Y_1
host = nodeX_2 Y_2
...
********************************

where 
P_I is the path which the workers access to locate work units.
P_I is the path to which the workers write results.

X_i is an element of {01, 02, ... 15}, and
Y_i is an integer specifying the number of workers to utilize on node X_i.

All configuration files are stored in the directory
../CMLROOT/srv/cfg



== Cluster Controller Operation ==

= Usage overview =
1. Create the cluster controller object on the head node.
2. Call object methods to start and stop MATLAB workers on the internal nodes.
3. Destroy the cluster controller object.


The cluster controller object is created within MATLAB by invoking the controller class constructor, cwc(),

After the object is created, workers are started using one of two method calls:
wSta(nodeXX) - start a single worker on node 'nodeXX'
cSta()       - start the maximum number of workers on all nodes specified in the configuration
               file.

Workers are stopped using the following method calls:
wSto(wNum) - where wNum is a unique integer assigned to each active worker.
cSto() - unconditionally stop the workers on every node.



== Workers ==

A MATLAB worker process is a .m script which executes a CML simulation,
for example, an error-rate simulation of APSK.
