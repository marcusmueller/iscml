== Cluster Interface ==

These functions implement a user interface for executing CML
simulations on the cluster.

These functions support executing simulations on the cluster or
locally.



The public functions are

CmlClusterSubmit(scenario, record)         Submit scenario and record for
                                           execution as jobs.

CmlClusterRetrieve(scenario, record)       Retrieve results from cluster
                                           execution.
                                           
CmlClusterStop(scenario, record)           Stop jobs from execution.



== Usage Example ==

Consider a user who wishes to execute 

scenario   'FskScenarios'
record      1

using the cluster, while on their local machine.
    
1. Submit job for execution.
>> CmlClusterSubmit('FskScenarios', 1)

2. Retrieve results
>> CmlClusterRetrieve

3. Plot results.
>> CmlPlot('FskScenarios', 1)




== Index of Terms ==

job - CML scenario and record submitted to PCS for execution.

local execution - executing CmlClusterSubmit directly on a user's computer
