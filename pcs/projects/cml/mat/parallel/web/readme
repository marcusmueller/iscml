== WebCML CML-Web Interface ==

These functions implement a user interface for creating job files
to submit to the WebCML web interface.


The user functions are

CmlWebSubmit(scenario, record)         Create WebCML job files from
                                       specified scenario and records.

CmlWebRetrieve                         Convert completed job files to CML
                                       output files.                                           

== Usage Example ==

Consider a user who wishes to execute 

scenario   'FskScenarios'
record      1

using the web interface.

1. Start CML on the user's local machine.
>> cd CMLROOT
>> CmlStartup

where >> denotes a MATLAB prompt.

    
2. Create job file for execution.
>> CmlWebSubmit('LdpcHmat', 3)
The job file is stored in
<cml_root>/jobs/JobIn/LdpcHmat_3.mat


3. This particular simulation utilizes and auxiliary data file
    to store the LDPC parity check matrix.

The data file is stored in <cml_root>/data/ldpc/test_ldpc_hmat.alist


4. Upload the job and data file to the web interface and retrieve
    the completed job file (separate document).


5. Place the retrieved job file in
   <cml_root>/jobs/JobOut


6. Convert job file to CML output file.
>> CmlWebRetrieve


7. Plot results.
>> CmlPlot('LdpcHmat', 3)
