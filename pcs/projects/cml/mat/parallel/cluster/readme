== WebCML Cluster Computing Interface ==

These functions implement a user interface for executing CML
simulations on the WCRL cluster.

These functions must be executed under a Linux account on the cluster
which has been configured to access the CML job manager daemon.


The user functions are

CmlClusterSubmit(scenario, record)         Submit scenario and record for
                                           execution as jobs.

CmlClusterRetrieve(scenario, record)       Retrieve results from cluster
                                           execution.
                                           
CmlClusterStop(scenario, record)           Stop jobs from execution.


The remaining functions in this directory support the user functions.


== Usage Example ==

Consider a user who wishes to execute 

scenario   'FskScenarios'
record      1

using the cluster.

1. Log in to the cluster using an assigned Linux account.


2. Start CML.
> matlab
>> cd CMLROOT
>> CmlStartup

where > denotes a Linux prompt and >> denotes a MATLAB prompt.

    
3. Submit job for execution.
>> CmlClusterSubmit('FskScenarios', 1)


4. Wait for job to complete.


5. Retrieve results
>> CmlClusterRetrieve


6. Download the CML output file using a preferred file transfer program.


7. Place the downloaded output file into CML's output directory.


8. Plot results.
Start Local CML.

>> CmlPlot('FskScenarios', 1)
