== Supporting Functions for CML Parallel Computing ==

These functions support CML's cluster and web-based parallel computing facilitie.

This document provides a short description of each function.
See the functions themselves for implementation details.


CmlJobSubMRunLocation.m           Determine simulation run location for job submission.
                                   Location determines job submission behavior.
                                   Location options are
                                      on a user's local machine
                                      under a Linux account on the cluster

ConsumeOutputQueue.m              Translate completed job files to CML output files
                                   and invoke MoveJobOutToCmlOut to move to 
                                   CML output directory.

MoveJobOutToCmlOut.m              Move a specified job file from job output queue
                                   to CML output directory.

CreateJob.m                       Create WebCML job file given sim_param and sim_state.

CreateJobs.m                      Read sim_param and sim_state for a given set of CML
                                   records and pass to function CreateJob for job file
                                   creation.

GetDirectoryListing.m             Get a listing of all .mat files in a specified directory.

ReadScenarioNameAndRecord.m       Determine scenario name and record given an underscore
                                   delimited string containing both.

SetSimLocationLocal.m             Set the simulation location to 'local' in sim_param.
