error rate comparison test
suite of scripts to automate error rate comparison between single-core
and cluster cml


== setup ==

check cml out of the google code repository on the cluster and local machines

on the windows machine, follow the instructions in winsync/readme
to configure file synchronization



== usage example ==

on the cluster
> ./launch_er_comparison.sh t_BerSim 1 2 /home/tferrett/cml


two screen sessions will be launched containing cluster and single sims.
 execute
> screen -ls
and wait for the screen sessions to complete


on windows, execute
winsync/sync
which copies the CML results from the cluster to the local machine
