= scenario_creation =

Library to convert spreadsheets to CML scenario files.

The parameters specifying a CML simulation are entered into a spreadsheet,
saved as a .csv file, and converted to a CML scenario file.



== Motivation ==

Manual creation of CML scenario files requires tedious copying of redundant information within a scenario file.

Within a given scenario file, certain parameters are unchanging for all records, while other parameters change.

Using a spreadsheet allows separation of unchanging and changing parameters, requiring specification of unchanging parameters only once, reducing redundancy.




== Usage ==

Create a spreadsheet containing simulation parameters.
See test/example.ods for syntax.

Save the spreadsheet into the directory csv/ as a .csv file using a semicolon ';' as the delimiter.

Within MATLAB, start CML and execute the function 'CmlCsv2Scen' to convert
from .csv to .m scenario file.

All scenario files are stored in <CMLROOT>/localscenarios




== Example ==

- Open the spreadsheet test/example.ods using OpenOffice calc.

- Save the sheet as 'fsk_uncoded.csv' in the directory csv/ using a semicolon ';' as the delimiter.

- Start CML within MATLAB and execute
  >> CmlCsv2Scen('fsk_uncoded.csv');

- Execute a simulation to test.
  >> CmlSimulate('fsk_uncoded', 1);
