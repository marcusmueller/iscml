The purpose of this directory is to centralize PCS and CML job manager testing results.

The motivations for testing are to confirm consistency of standalone and cluster CML results,
and provide guidlines for selecting simulation parameters.
Proper parameter selection ensures that simulations generate desired results in acceptable time.



== Procedure for Testing ==

1. Determine test goal.

2. Create simulation records and place in SysTest.m.

3. Execute tests in required modes: standalone and/or cluster.

4. Store resulting CML output filesin output/.

5. Store figures generated from results in fig/.



== Files and Directories ==

cml_output/     CML output files storing simulation results.

fig/            Figures containing test output.

SysTest.m       Scenario file containing simulation records.

readme          This document.



== Test Descriptions ==

Tests are described as text files having the convention

Test_<N>_<desc>

where N denotes the test number, and desc is a short description of the test.

see "Test_1_64qam" as an example of content and style.
