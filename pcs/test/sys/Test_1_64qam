=== Test 1 ===


== Short Description ==

Low error-rate simulation of uncoded 64-QAM

= Cases =
Standalone
Cluster


= Critical Parameters
SNR                0:0.25:30
minBER             1e-10
minFER             1e-10
max_frame_errors   100
max_trials         1e9
framesize          1e5


== Scenario and Record ==

Scenario Record Desc
SysTest  5      standalone QAM
SysTest  6      cluster QAM



== Results ==

Curve smooth, trials and frame errors not close to limits at high SNR.
How was the simulation stopped? Manually.
Returned results from my sim while still running.


Recommendation: carefully choose 
max_trials
framesize
max_frame_errors

to ensure that simulation stops on its own.


            Runtime  Agree?
Cluster     ~1hr     y
StandAlone  ~24hr
